# ==========================================
# 1. Web Framework & Core (Dashboard Engine)
# ==========================================

# The core framework for building the interactive data dashboard.

streamlit

# File system monitoring utility.
# Required by Streamlit to auto-reload the app when you modify code during development.

watchdog


# ==========================================
# 2. Data Manipulation (Data Processing)
# ==========================================

# Essential for handling structured data (DataFrames) before visualization.

pandas

# Fundamental package for numerical computing.
# CRITICAL: Pinned to <2.0.0 to ensure compatibility with Pandas and other libraries that haven't migrated to NumPy 2.0 yet.

numpy<2.0.0


# ==========================================
# 3. Visualization (Charts & Graphs)
# ==========================================

# Primary library for interactive charts (zoom, hover, filter).
# Best for displaying time-series data of solar flares.

plotly

# Foundation library for static plotting.

matplotlib

# High-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics (based on matplotlib).

seaborn


# ==========================================
# 4. Data Sources (Database & Storage)
# ==========================================

# Official driver to connect Streamlit to the ClickHouse OLAP database.
# Used for querying aggregated metrics (e.g., average flare intensity).

clickhouse-connect

# Official Python client for MinIO Object Storage.
# Used to retrieve raw files or images (e.g., solar images) directly from the storage bucket.

minio

# Standard library for making HTTP requests.
# Useful if the dashboard needs to call external APIs or check health endpoints.

requests


# ==========================================
# 5. Utilities (Image Processing)
# ==========================================

# Python Imaging Library (PIL).
# Used to process and display images (e.g., rendering Solar Flare images fetched from MinIO) in the dashboard.
